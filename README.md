# README
This is a repo template üë®üèº‚Äçüî¨  


## Description ü§ù
Short. 
What was your motivation?  
What problem does it solve?  
What application does?
Why you used the technologies you used?



## Getting started üöÄ 

##  Development üêô
- There are TODO comments in the code.
- Install git hooks. Run this command `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- [Configure GPG keys if required](doc/GPG-KEYS.md)


### Building üß±

### Deploying üèãüèº



### Branching strategy üö®
This branching strategy will save you. 
- `number of environments == number of protected branches` e.g. for `prod`, `stg`, `dev` environments, you should have `prod`, `stg`, `dev` branches respectively.
    - Rename `master`/`main` branch to `prod`
- Do development on `dev` branch. Propagate changes from `dev` -> `stg` -> `prod` branches. CI/CD will deploy to respective environments upon merging. Merging is a deployment trigger.
- How to do development on the `dev` branch.
    - If you have a dev environment per a developer (temporary/disposable environments üòé), do a [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) on a `dev` branch. 
        - CI/CD should be configured that features branches are deployed to respective personal `dev` environments.
    - If the `dev` environment is shared for all developers, do a [Trunk Based Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Ijkq6Myfc) on a `dev` branch. Avoid further branching, bug if you do so, do not hold feature branches for long before merging them to `dev` branch.

This is so called `Environment Branch Model` with one improvement - the default branch is **prod** <s>master</s>.

- Environment branches make it easy for you to separate your in-progress code from your stable code. Using environment branches and deploying from them means you will always know exactly what code is running on your servers in each of your environments.
- In order to keep your environment branches in sync with the environments, it‚Äôs a best practice to only execute a merge into an environment branch at the time you intend to deploy.


#### Semantic Rleases
- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to bump the version. [READ THIS SUMMARY](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). 
- Versions are follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) convention
- Following this convention, CI automation will create release and pre-release tags automatically.
- Following this convention, CI automation will generate `CHANGELOG.md`  automatically.
- [semver comparsion operators](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver)

- To trigger a new release without actually making any changes, run `git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: trigger release with empty commit" && git push`
